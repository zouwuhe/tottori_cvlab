computer vision in tottori-cvlab
1. calibarate IR-Color cameras with no-overlapping cameras
 (1)calibrate laser on the board: calibrate_laser_version3
 (2)calibrate internal parameters of IR-RGB camera(e.g. kinect): internal calibrate(IR and RGB)
 (3)calibrate depth parameters of depth camera: depth_calibration(IR_D)_ver2
 (4)collecte data for calibrating relative pose(R,T) between two non-overlapping kinect: calibrate_laser_version3
 (5)calibrate relative pose (R,T) between two non-overlapping kinect based on collected data
